        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy pasta dish incorporates a classic combination of flavors: 
            lemon, chicken, and garlic. It's a nice change of pace from the usual pasta fare.
             It's even quicker to make if you have leftover chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 lemon, quartered</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</strong></li>
            <li><strong>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 (8 ounce) package rotelle pasta</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 cup heavy cream</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                 Place chicken in a lightly greased baking dish. Squeeze lemon over both sides of 
                 the chicken breasts and season both sides using 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder and ¾ 
                 teaspoon pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear and chicken is 
                 no longer pink inside, about 40 minutes..</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, season the chicken 
                broth with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
                 Bring to a boil and add lemon juice and pasta. Cook over medium heat, 
                 stirring occasionally, until all liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Cut cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces and stir 
                into cooked pasta, along with the cream and lemon zest. Cook, stirring, over 
                low heat for 5 minutes</li>
        </ol>
